**MythInformation.tech** is an AI-powered "Story Detective" designed to navigate the dense, non-linear lore of modern video games. By transforming chaotic wiki articles and scripts into interactive 3D Knowledge Graphs, it reveals hidden connections and secret alliances that even the most dedicated fans might miss.

## 📽️ The Vision
Video game stories (like *Elden Ring*, *The Witcher*, or *Destiny*) are increasingly complex, often hidden in item descriptions or optional dialogue. **MythInformation** uses Data Science and Generative AI to "decode" these stories. It doesn't just list facts; it maps the **relationships** between characters, factions, and artifacts, allowing players to visualize the narrative web in real-time.

## 🚀 How It Works
1.  **Lore Ingestion:** Users paste text from wikis, scripts, or fan-lore into the "Detective's Notebook."
2.  **Neural Extraction:** Gemini 1.5 reads the text and extracts structured data (Nodes and Edges).
3.  **Graph Synthesis:** The backend runs community detection algorithms to categorize characters into factions automatically.
4.  **3D Visualization:** The data is rendered into a Three.js environment where users can zoom, rotate, and click nodes to view "Detective Dossiers" on specific characters.

## 🏆 Why It Wins
This project moves beyond simple "AI wrappers" by combining **Generative AI** with **Graph Theory**. It solves a real problem for gamers and creators by providing a tool that makes complex information both beautiful and searchable.
