**MythInformation.tech** is an AI-powered "Story Detective" designed to navigate the dense, non-linear lore of modern franchises. By transforming chaotic wiki articles and scripts into interactive 3D **Galactic Knowledge Graphs**, it reveals hidden connections and secret alliances that even the most dedicated fans might miss.

## 📽️ The Vision
Video game and movie lore are increasingly complex. **MythInformation** uses Data Science and Generative AI to "decode" these stories. It doesn't just list facts; it maps the **multiversal relationships** between characters, allowing players to visualize narrative clusters as solar systems in a vast digital galaxy.

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Multiversal Clustering:** Characters are automatically grouped into "Solar Systems" based on their source work (e.g., FNAF 1 vs. FNAF 2).
*   **Star Magnitude:** Characters with more connections glow brighter and appear larger using **Degree Centrality** metrics.
*   **Crossover "Bridge" Detection:** Characters appearing in multiple works are rendered with **Multi-Segment Segmented Coronas**, visually showing their dual-affiliations.
*   **Fluid Physics Engine:** Real-time collision detection and spring-forces create a "liquid" movement feel when adding new lore.
*   **Procedural Starfield:** A native 15,000-point 3D background for a cinematic immersive experience.
